1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,560
I used to spend up to $500 a month on Cursor,

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,340
but the worst part wasn't the money.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,440
It was the uncertainty because in some months,

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,120
I would barely hit the monthly limits

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,100
while other months I would watch my bill go up to $488.31.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,500
So last week, I finally unsubscribed from Cursor

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,700
and started using Claude Code instead.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,980
But Claude Code comes with its own set of problems.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,180
And I really didn't like that it didn't have a file tree

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,100
to browse the project.

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,280
It didn't show me the changes that it made.

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,720
and that it had me locked into the clawed-only models

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,020
without access to models like GPT-5.

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,780
But then, just a few days after switching,

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,520
I found a tool that solved all of these problems and more.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,420
And the best part was that it was free to use.

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,480
This tool is called Conductor.

18
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,620
And after testing tons of different options,

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,820
this one to me is the first one

20
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,300
that actually feels like a worthy competitor to Cursor.

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,860
So let me show you why.

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,100
Because let's start with the most obvious issue.

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,200
Cloud Code runs in the terminal.

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,900
And listen, I get it.

25
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,360
If you are technical, you might love it.

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,560
But most of my students are not

27
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,820
and they will find it genuinely scary.

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,980
But even if you do love the terminal,

29
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,580
you're still missing out on very important features

30
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,380
that will make you a dramatically better

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,980
no-code software architect.

32
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,300
And the biggest one is simply being able to see

33
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,960
what the AI is doing.

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,300
It's kind of like hiring a contractor

35
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,500
to renovate your house,

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,680
but they won't let you see the blueprints

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,380
or walk the job site.

38
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,800
You just have to come home one day, randomly,

39
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,800
after they finished and hope that they didn't accidentally

40
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,980
break anything that they weren't supposed to.

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,260
This is where a file tree lets you see exactly

42
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,860
what files AI creates.

43
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,520
So you start to understand what the app folder is,

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,420
where components should live,

45
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,960
how your project is structured, and most importantly,

46
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,280
you can verify that the AI actually did what you expected

47
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,320
without writing code.

48
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,740
You also need a way to see the changes that clawed code made

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,640
because this will give you the confidence

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,700
that it didn't touch a bunch of other files

51
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,020
that if it did would be a sign

52
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,940
that your prompt wasn't clear enough.

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,960
This is actually a key problem to look out for

54
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,120
and one that will help you avoid large changes

55
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,460
that you didn't ask for.

56
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,340
Because when you open Conductor,

57
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,560
it really feels like a proper editor without the code though.

58
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,040
You've got your file tree.

59
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Let me just show it to you.

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,560
You got your file tree on the right, right here.

61
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:36,060
So you can click through the project where all the files are and even click on them to see what's in sight.

62
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:47,360
In rare cases where you do want to edit a specific file manually, you also have a button up here that will open this project in your favorite editor, which for me is still Cursor.

63
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,060
But you have a lot of them available.

64
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,400
You have like Cursor, VS Code, Zed, Windsurf, Ghosty Warp, right?

65
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,920
Even Anti-Gravity.

66
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,500
and you can even copy the path if you really want to.

67
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,260
You can also see all the files that changed,

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,620
which again, while you don't have to code,

69
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,340
you definitely have to understand what your project is doing

70
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,120
if you want to keep it scalable in the future.

71
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,500
So there is also a run button down here

72
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,440
that will automatically start your development server

73
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,720
and even a review button that will run a full code review

74
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,220
all without running any commands manually

75
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,560
or asking a terminal version of Claude anything.

76
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,440
And while all of these differences might sound small,

77
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,500
I guarantee that they will make you faster

78
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,700
and more confident in building with AI

79
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,120
while again, never writing code.

80
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,900
But it's great to have a pretty interface,

81
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,820
but what really makes Conductor powerful

82
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,740
is how it handles the scariest part of AI coding.

83
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,800
Because here's the moment that every AI coder knows.

84
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,240
You ask the model to rebuild this function

85
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,940
or fix this bug when clicking this and this button.

86
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,980
Then it goes away and after a few minutes it says done,

87
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,040
but suddenly half of your app is literally broken.

88
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,280
Now you're spending the next two hours undoing damage

89
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,860
instead of building something new.

90
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,540
You're digging through your history,

91
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,520
trying to figure out where it went wrong

92
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,160
before ultimately accepting that the working version

93
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,200
that you used to have is gone forever.

94
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,740
This is the problem that GitHub branches and work trees,

95
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,620
two very important words that you need to remember

96
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,279
if you don't know them yet, they solve this

97
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:23,820
because they kind of work like Google Docs version history.

98
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,280
You can see every change that was ever made

99
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,800
roll back to any past point in time

100
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,640
and nothing is ever truly lost.

101
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,300
And a branch is sort of the same concept,

102
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,820
but for your entire code base.

103
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,480
It's a parallel copy

104
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,960
where you can break things without consequences.

105
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,500
And then work trees take branches one step further

106
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,300
by creating a completely isolated copy,

107
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,139
which means that you can have multiple agents

108
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,900
working in isolated copies of the same project

109
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,440
at the same time without these agents fighting each other

110
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,320
or getting confused about code

111
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,140
that they didn't write or edit.

112
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,000
And the best part of all of this is that

113
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,040
you truly don't need to understand how any of this works

114
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,540
because Conductor abstracts this functionality away

115
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,800
with something that they call WorkSpaces,

116
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,540
which automatically create a new branch

117
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,160
and a work tree for you.

118
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,120
This means that you can literally go wild.

119
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,280
You can delete files.

120
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,680
You can do all types of things.

121
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,000
All you have to do is click.

122
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,820
So once you have all the projects here,

123
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,640
you can just click new workspace

124
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,400
and then Conductor will set this up for you, right?

125
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,060
So you see now I have a completely isolated copy

126
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,060
of the same project.

127
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,400
And here I can do all types of things.

128
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,980
I could like delete files if I wanted to

129
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,860
and do all types of like crazy stuff.

130
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,920
And then if it works, great,

131
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,960
because we can get these changes back

132
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,140
into your main project in just a moment.

133
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,360
But here's the thing.

134
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,340
If it breaks, you can literally just archive

135
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,860
this broken workspace and your main project,

136
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,160
let me just do this right now,

137
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,340
never knew that these changes even happened.

138
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,680
It's like you never broke anything to begin with.

139
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,120
But now the question is,

140
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,160
when you have built something great in your safe workspace,

141
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,020
how does it actually get back into your main project?

142
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,680
This is where a lot of people will get lost

143
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,340
in these GitHub terminologies

144
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,619
because there's branches and merges and rebases

145
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,840
and it all sounds very complicated.

146
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,400
But the concept is actually really simple.

147
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's go back to this like Google Docs analogy

148
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,980
because imagine you have a contract

149
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,200
that needs to be signed

150
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,500
and you have made edits to this contract

151
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,740
and now you need to send it back to the other party

152
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,820
for them to check.

153
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,020
So you say, here's what I changed,

154
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,940
please review it before we both sign this contract.

155
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,300
With GitHub, this is called a pull request

156
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,300
and it's essentially a formal,

157
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,240
listen, here are my changes,

158
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,440
Let's review all of them before merging them back into the main project.

159
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,980
And in Conductor, you can literally just press a single button to do this.

160
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,640
So all you have to do is literally go up here and click the PR button, right?

161
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,640
Create PR.

162
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,440
And then what it does is it opens a pull request on your behalf on GitHub.

163
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,940
You can see this right here.

164
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,320
There's actually a custom prompt that it will inject into the current chat.

165
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,860
So you don't have to explain anything.

166
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,780
And then before you know it, it will actually create this pull request for you.

167
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,480
And you can see this right here.

168
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:19,840
Perfect.

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,080
Let me create the PR right now, creating the pull request on GitHub.

170
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,440
It runs all of these commands completely for you.

171
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:39,000
And then before you know it, the button up here has turned into PR33, which means in my case, this is the 33rd pull request that I have opened in this particular project.

172
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,140
And you can actually click this button again and then open it inside of GitHub.

173
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:49,820
And then on this page, it can actually show you exactly what changed as a text summary and what

174
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,860
files changed and how many lines have changed. So for example, here you can see that 55 lines have

175
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,500
been added, 39 lines have been removed. So it's a relatively small change. Three files have changed.

176
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,460
You can actually see which files changed, but again, it would require you to, you know, like

177
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,280
read code. You don't really want that, but at least you can see that only three files were changed,

178
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,260
which is great, right? You can see that there was one commit, which hopefully you already know what

179
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,240
that is, and you can see the entire conversation. But here's the thing. You have made some changes,

180
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,080
you have created the pull request, but how do you actually know if you're not a developer,

181
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:30,180
if these changes are safe to merge into the main project? This is where AI code reviewers come in.

182
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:37,180
So tools like Cursors, BugBot, AugmentCodes, CodeReview, CodeRabbit, CodeXReview, Graptile,

183
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,700
they all come into play at this very stage during a pull request and then automatically analyze

184
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,740
your changes. If they find problems, you can literally just copy their feedback back into

185
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,420
Conductor and make fixes. And then Conductor will automatically update this pull request,

186
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,940
and then reviewers can run again and you can keep this loop going back and forth until you are

187
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,039
confident that the changes you made are actually safe. This is actually the workflow that real

188
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,660
engineers use every day. And in this particular case, I've actually introduced a bunch of errors

189
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,020
into this project so you can see what this looks like. So you can see here I have the

190
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:22,700
greptile code reviewer running. And it's funny, this pull request intentionally introduces multiple

191
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,020
critical security vulnerabilities and removes essential protections for demonstration purposes.

192
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,719
Yeah, exactly. So you can see that it found like all types of things here. It has a confidence score

193
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,120
of zero from five important files have changed, right?

194
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,020
And there's a bunch of different problems.

195
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,900
Like here, there's a fake API key that I introduced,

196
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,300
or there's some like logging,

197
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,340
like remove before production, right?

198
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,420
So it picked up on all of these changes.

199
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,680
And if I wanted to,

200
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,600
I could literally just copy these, for example, right?

201
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,540
And be like, okay, wow.

202
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,460
Like prompt to fix this,

203
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,080
Graptile in particular gives you a prompt to fix this,

204
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,580
which you could just like copy.

205
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,380
and then do just copy it back in here and then go through the loop as explained.

206
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,840
And this entire workflow is made so easy by Conductor that it becomes a no-brainer to use.

207
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:19,180
But there's one big problem, a limitation that Claude code on its own can't fix.

208
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,340
Because when you use only Claude code directly, you're locked into the Claude models,

209
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,220
which means Haiku, Sonnet and Opus. That's your entire menu.

210
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:32,120
And listen, before you start commenting down below that Opus is like Alien Tech and the best model,

211
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:39,140
It's not. It's a really great model at generating code and iterative sort of like coding together

212
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,820
with you. But GPT-5, it's actually better at a lot of tasks like code reviews, bug fixes,

213
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:50,340
and creating large architectural plans. It's also better at working on its own for hours,

214
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:56,460
if you know what you're doing. I personally use GPT-5 High whenever I build something high stakes,

215
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,620
like a payment integration or large architectural changes, maybe a big API integration, something

216
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:08,740
like that, right? And just a while back, I built out a Stripe webhook and payment flow using GPT-5

217
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,520
Codex High. It took easily 40 minutes, right? Like way longer than Opus would have, but it just

218
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,860
knocked it out of the park while I was working on another thing. It just ran on its own, tested

219
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:24,440
everything, and then delivered something that worked right away. Then I used the standard GPT-5

220
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,900
to review everything because just to get this out of the way, Codex is really great at autonomous

221
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,680
work and the standard vanilla GPT-5 variants, they are much better at detailed analysis,

222
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,260
reviewing that type of stuff. So I often use GPT-5 to review everything that Opus, for example,

223
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,660
builds. And typically there are things that GPT-5 will find that Opus messed up. Sometimes it's just

224
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,940
duplicated code or things that it didn't consider, but other times it's actually critical bugs that

225
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,180
Opus just couldn't catch. And if you just use cloud code on its own, there's just no way for

226
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,120
you to tap into the benefits of both of these worlds. But in Conductor, you have full access

227
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:09,940
to both. You're literally one click away to switch from Opus 4.5 to GPT 5.2. This is what the best

228
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,340
AI builders do today, because when you have access to both, you get the incredible power of Opus 4.5,

229
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:21,680
which is a really great model with the confidence and better thinking capabilities of GPT 5.

230
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,260
Use Claude for fast building and everyday tasks and then switch to GPT-5 for deep reviews,

231
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,180
larger plans, because it's just better at it.

232
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,860
And because you're no longer locked into one of these model families, you get both.

233
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,740
But it gets even better, because just like a cursor, you don't have to choose one model

234
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,280
at a time.

235
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,480
Because AI coding happens usually one thing at a time.

236
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,880
You prompt, you wait, you review, you prompt again, always waiting for the last thing to

237
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,200
finish before you start the next. But what if you didn't have to wait? What if you could have one

238
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,020
agent build a feature while another answers a question about your code base or updates some

239
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:06,300
documentation that is due? I do this constantly. I have one tab for example where Opus is building a

240
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,540
new feature or a new dashboard. I have a second tab open where I ask with Sonnet because it's a bit

241
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,560
cheaper to answer questions about an API while I'm planning a next feature or something like that.

242
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,700
And then sometimes if I'm going wild, because you know, like some models, they are like slower than

243
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:29,380
others, I have a third tab open where for example use GPT-5-high to update documentation or plan

244
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:35,020
something because all of these can do work independently at the same time. But in Cloud

245
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,260
Code, you would literally need to have multiple terminal windows open, you would have to manually

246
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:46,600
create all these branches and work trees and even then Cloud Code and Codex aren't even sharing

247
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,860
context with each other so it can get chaotic really fast. In Conductor however you can just

248
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,820
open multiple tabs inside the same workspace. So let me just open a new workspace once again just

249
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:03,320
wait until it's like done and now I have a single tab right and I can choose let's say Opus and say

250
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:11,880
UltraThink and say research this code base and give me some improvements right and then I can

251
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:18,840
take this code actually, I can copy the code, open a new tab right here and run the same prompt,

252
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:26,460
but let's say with GPT-5, let's say, hi, right? And now I have both of these agents do the same

253
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,520
task actually, because in this case, it's a read-only task. They have access to the same

254
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,300
project, the same files, the same workspace. This is truly the closest thing to cursor that I have

255
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,860
seen. So at this point, you're probably asking yourself, what does this all actually cost? This

256
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,440
actually my favorite part because remember I was spending up to $500 a month on cursor and I've

257
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,040
seen screenshots of people hitting $3,000 or more so here's the deal. Conductor itself is completely

258
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,240
free. It's not like cursor where you have to pay for the privilege of using their infrastructure

259
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:04,660
to actually do anything with AI because Conductor just uses your existing Claude and ChatGPT

260
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,440
subscription. So let's do the math. Because currently I have just two subscriptions. There is

261
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:19,420
Claude Max 5x for $100 a month and ChatGPT+ for Codex for $20 a month. That's just $120 a month for

262
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:28,000
a lot of usage. Way more usage than you can get out of the $200 cursor Ultraplan. Plus you get both

263
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:35,040
model families, no token anxiety, a user interface that is really easy to use, work trees, parallel

264
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,320
agents and everything else that I've just shown you. There's also a bunch of features that I

265
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,060
haven't even touched on yet. There's so much more to go through, not to mention that this team

266
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,240
ships updates all the time. It literally shipped updates over Christmas. Can't make that up.

267
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,760
But let me be fair and also say this, because Cursor still has some pretty high advantages. For

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,920
example, Cursor's plan mode is by far genuinely the best in the industry. And I do hope that

269
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,700
Conductor adds something similar that works across the models that they support. There's also no

270
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,980
debug mode and no internal browser. So if you're using these features, then Cursor will still be

271
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,220
your best bet. But truth be told, I haven't used neither one of these features a lot at all. They're

272
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:23,060
just not part of my daily workflow. But another big potential downside is that Conductor might

273
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,240
take a little bit longer, a few hours or a day or so, to make new models available. I'm currently

274
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:34,560
talking to them and see exactly how this works. I might be wrong about this but there is definitely

275
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,860
still some work to be done. But in return I get way more tokens and almost everything that I need

276
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:46,140
from Cursor for my daily work at a fraction of the cost and most importantly no token anxiety and I

277
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,580
know exactly how I pay how much I pay every single month. But knowing about Conductor is just the

278
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,500
first step. I made a full setup tutorial with step-by-step instructions so you can do everything

279
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,600
that I have shown you in this video that you can watch right here.
